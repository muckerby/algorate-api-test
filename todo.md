# Meetings Table and Import Service - Todo List

## Phase 1: Database table setup and security âœ… COMPLETE
- [x] Create meetings table schema in Supabase
- [x] Create meetings table in Supabase database
- [x] Apply RLS security policies to meetings table (RLS enabled successfully!)
- [x] Fix RLS security SQL syntax issues (created simplified version)
- [x] Test simplified RLS SQL without comments (still fails with suspicious content)
- [x] Try enabling RLS via Supabase UI instead of SQL (SUCCESS!)
- [x] Add individual RLS policies through Supabase UI (SUCCESS!)
  - [x] Tried multiple SQL approaches - all flagged as suspicious
  - [x] User's naming convention initially worked but then failed again
  - [x] Fixed syntax error in FOR clause
  - [x] Even basic names like "allowservice" flagged as suspicious
  - [x] Found Supabase UI policy creation form
  - [x] Create service_role policy through UI (SUCCESS!)
  - [x] Policy 1: Service role full access ("Import service access" created)
  - [ ] Policy 2: Authenticated users read-only (optional)
  - [ ] Policy 3: Anonymous users read-only (optional)
- [x] Verify RLS policies are active and working (service_role policy confirmed active)
- [x] Confirm table is ready for import service (READY!)

## Phase 2: Import service development and testing
- [ ] Set up Railway hosting environment (PRIORITY)
  - [x] Research Railway vs Azure scaling and enterprise capabilities
  - [x] Decide on Railway + Supabase strategy (start simple, scale smart)
  - [x] Create Railway account/project (SUCCESS - GitHub connected, $5 credit)
  - [x] Discover Railway has NO Australian regions (only Singapore closest)
  - [x] Decide to test Railway Singapore first, migrate to Azure if geo-blocked
  - [x] Create empty project for meetings import service test
  - [x] Create API connectivity test service (Flask app with web interface)
  - [x] Create GitHub repo "algorate-api-test" and connect to Railway
  - [x] Railway service created and connected to GitHub repo (4 changes detected)
  - [ ] Configure service settings and Singapore region deployment
  - [ ] Deploy test service to Railway Singapore
  - [ ] Test Punting Form API access from Singapore (THE MOMENT OF TRUTH!)
  - [ ] If successful: proceed with full service / If blocked: migrate to Azure
  - [ ] Set up environment variables (API key, Supabase credentials)
  - [ ] Configure deployment pipeline
- [ ] Define service architecture and requirements
  - [x] Hosting strategy (Railway Australian region)
  - [x] Execution method (containerized Python service)
  - [x] Scheduling approach (cron-based daily execution)
  - [x] Inclusion/exclusion parameters (Australian TAB meetings only)
- [ ] Create meetings import service structure
- [ ] Deploy and test in Railway environment
- [ ] Test API connectivity with correct endpoint
- [ ] Test data transformation and database insertion
- [ ] Validate import results
- [ ] Handle error cases and edge conditions
- [ ] Configure scheduling and monitoring
- [ ] Handle error cases and edge conditions

## Phase 3: Service validation and documentation
- [ ] Run full import test with real data
- [ ] Document service usage and configuration
- [ ] Create service deployment instructions
- [ ] Validate system is ready for next table (races)

## Current Status
- **BLOCKED**: RLS security policies failing due to syntax error
- **Next Step**: Fix SQL syntax and apply security policies
- **Test Date**: 26/08/2025
